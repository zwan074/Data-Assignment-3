    "\n",
    "A recommender system, or a recommender engine intends to seek prediction of 'rating' or 'preference' for a user that would rank an item or event, mainly used in commercial web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "They have been utilized in various areas over the last ten years, commonly used as playlist generators for video and music services such as Youtube, Netflix, and BiliBili, product recommenders like Amazon, Trademe, and Ebay, and content or news based recommenders for social media platforms as Facebook, Twitter and Instergram. Also, there are other popular recommender systems being utilized for specific topics as hotels booking, dating matching, and online competition game team up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow and monetization are the core concept associated with commercial web applications for internet. Simply speaking, flow is the measurement that the number of visitings for a web application, while monetization evaluates its overall income for keeping the business up and running continuously and healthily. (i.e. advertisement income of Youtube, membership subscriptions for Netflix, and fees/charges for each successfully sale for Amazon ). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, recommendation engine is one of the key part for monetization that allows finding consumers' real demand through directing them to their most interest items or services. In addition to this , owners of commercial web applications, would be able accurately deploy advertisements and services to their customers based on a successful recommendation engine set up, for example ,playlist generators (Youtube) could generate just right advertisements to their viewers , and product recommenders like Amazon could pushed customers related products when they are viewing a certain item. Thus, it would optimise the resource usage and amplify income for a commercial organisation who has developed such kind of commercial web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project , we would implement a ***'breath first'*** strategy so as to explore as much lifecycle and implementations for a recommendation engine , such as the input and output data structure, machine learning algorithms, evaluation standard for comparison of different algorithms, and its position and role in architecture of a commercial web applications , instead of undertaking ***in-depth*** research on specific algorithms as per their theory and implementations. Thus, we will simply use an existing library to compute our findings and recommendations for this project.\n",

    "The datasets for a commercial web application have almost never been exposed for public usage or research, as they are private and strategy assets for business. Normally they are generated through \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are existing web source regarding recommendation engine study for us to play with , which is Amazon product data prepared by Associate Professor Julian McAuley, UCSD at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, user activates for a commercial web app could be concluded as viewing a certain web page , purchasing products, comments and rank items , content or news etc. It is quite difficult to summarise a standard data structure for a recommendation engine due to the variety demands and requirements for various business activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a classic data structure format has been widely used after long term experimentation and operation with major internet giant companies such as Amazon and Facebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***user id*** : unique user id\n",
    "- ***item id*** : unique item id\n",
    "- ***behaviour type*** : type of behaviour , i.e. purchase or view an item\n",
    "- ***context*** : behaviour context, including location and time etc.\n",
    "- ***behaviour weight*** : weight could be the viewing length for a video or rank for an item \n",
    "- ***behaviour content*** : if a user comments something, the content could be saved as a text file. If user click an item, the content could be a binary input.\n",
