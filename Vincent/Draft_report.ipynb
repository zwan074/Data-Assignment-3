    "\n",
    "A recommender system, or a recommender engine intends to seek prediction of 'rating' or 'preference' for a user that would rank an item or event, mainly used in commercial web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "They have been utilized in various areas over the last ten years, commonly used as playlist generators for video and music services such as Youtube, Netflix, and BiliBili, product recommenders like Amazon, Trademe, and Ebay, and content or news based recommenders for social media platforms as Facebook, Twitter and Instergram. Also, there are other popular recommender systems being utilized for specific topics as hotels booking, dating matching, and online competition game team up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow and monetization are the core concept associated with commercial web applications for internet. Simply speaking, flow is the measurement that the number of visitings for a web application, while monetization evaluates its overall income for keeping the business up and running continuously and healthily. (i.e. advertisement income of Youtube, membership subscriptions for Netflix, and fees/charges for each successfully sale for Amazon ). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, recommendation engine is one of the key part for monetization that allows finding consumers' real demand through directing them to their most interest items or services. In addition to this , owners of commercial web applications, would be able accurately deploy advertisements and services to their customers based on a successful recommendation engine set up, for example ,playlist generators (Youtube) could generate just right advertisements to their viewers , and product recommenders like Amazon could pushed customers related products when they are viewing a certain item. Thus, it would optimise the resource usage and amplify income for a commercial organisation who has developed such kind of commercial web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project , we would implement a ***'breath first'*** strategy so as to explore as much lifecycle and implementations for a recommendation engine , such as the input and output data structure, machine learning algorithms, evaluation standard for comparison of different algorithms, and its position and role in architecture of a commercial web applications , instead of undertaking ***in-depth*** research on specific algorithms as per their theory and implementations. Thus, we will simply use an existing library to compute our findings and recommendations for this project.\n",

    "The datasets for a commercial web application have almost never been exposed for public usage or research, as they are private and strategy assets for business. Normally they are generated through \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are existing web source regarding recommendation engine study for us to play with , which is Amazon product data prepared by Associate Professor Julian McAuley, UCSD at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, user activates for a commercial web app could be concluded as viewing a certain web page , purchasing products, comments and rank items , content or news etc. It is quite difficult to summarise a standard data structure for a recommendation engine due to the variety demands and requirements for various business activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a classic data structure format has been widely used after long term experimentation and operation with major internet giant companies such as Amazon and Facebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***user id*** : unique user id\n",
    "- ***item id*** : unique item id\n",
    "- ***behaviour type*** : type of behaviour , i.e. purchase or view an item\n",
    "- ***context*** : behaviour context, including location and time etc.\n",
    "- ***behaviour weight*** : weight could be the viewing length for a video or rank for an item \n",
    "- ***behaviour content*** : if a user comments something, the content could be saved as a text file. If user click an item, the content could be a binary input.\n",

    "In accordance with this graph, this is a classic system architecture for a commercial web application based on technical stack Spring Framework in JAVA language, https://spring.io/. \n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is sourced from ***mall*** , an open source online shop platform project with a distributed system architecture, https://github.com/macrozheng/mall. It has the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "***API gateway*** - it can take care of securing and routing messages, hiding services, and integrated with many other services in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Service registry*** - applications can’t always know the exact location of other services, if they need to make inter process communications, Service registry should be checked first to find other services addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Circuit breakers*** - distributed systems can be unreliable. Requests might encounter timeouts or fail completely. In high concurrency environment, it could provide function to throttling load.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Load Ballancers*** - it provides functions that load requests evenly to different services with same functions, that improves stability to the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Microservices*** - building small and fine, self-contained, ready to run applications, that can bring great flexibility and added resilience to the system. It is a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, weak coupling with others, which can lead to many additional benefits, such as easier maintenance, improved productivity, greater fault tolerance, better business alignment, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Cloud configuration*** - normally configuration can’t simply be embedded inside the application/micro services, while it has to be flexible enough to cope with multiple applications, environments, and service instances, as well as deal with dynamic changes without downtime in order to keep the configurations safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Message Queues*** - a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored on the queue until they are processed and deleted. Each message is processed only once, by a single consumer. Message queues can be used to decouple heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Databases*** - store all the information and records.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Log system*** - store all the operational logs/records that occur in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Deployment tools*** - deployment automation tool stack that containerizing services/apps in a sandbox/virtual machine and deploy them onto the real machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recommender engine would include some microservices being embedded in this complex system, which is connected with all the components as above. However, it has weak coupling with other microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical process would be that a request needs to be checked at ***API gateway*** for its security/identification, secondly, it looks up the ip address of recommender engine cluster at ***Service registry***, then it is forwarded onto one of recommender engine server through message queue and load balancer system for processing , and lastly, the recommended items of this request are returned to the front end browser for viewing and recorded at the ***Log system*** for maintenance and debugging purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of recommender engine cluster, Availability and Partition tolerance have been implemented in accordance with ***CAP theorem***, which implies that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability, as per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have pushed a static model and database for online recommender engine, which makes the system stateless. Thus, its microservices could be duplicated as much as we needs in order to deal with fault tolerance and high concurrency situation through load balancers, i.e. Black Friday Sales or Shopping Holidays for famous commercial web apps such as Amazon , Ebay, Taobao, Alibaba etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the online environment and database are updating dynamically, we need gap to train and test both online and offline models so as to undertake research and improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Availability and Partition tolerance (AP) is the most common choice for system architecture of recommender engine.\n"
